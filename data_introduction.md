The data we used for fine-tuning was selected from the validation set of the two datasets, consisting of six distinct scenes, each with unique characteristics. This data is all collected from open-source real-world data obtained through sensors. The data has been preprocessed by our code. It includes various traffic features such as vehicle positions, speeds, times, and cities, as well as map information like lane markings and intersections. For pre-training, we require all the training data from the entire dataset.
